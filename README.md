# CutnTag Data Processing

This repository records the processing pipeline of Cut&Tag sequencing data. All steps using Bash and R (v.4.3.1).

This is adapted from Ye Zhang's incredibly useful Cut&Tag processing and analysis tutorial from the Henikoff group which can be found at (https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bjk2kkye). All code used for this pipeline is enclosed and labelled in numerical order
